    player "So you're saying you need someone to go in and write a script to delete that data?"
    mala "I talked with Goro, and we have a ticket written up to automate the process for our next sprint."
    mala "You and Darius will actually be working on it! (HAPPY)"
    mala "But for now, we want you to manually go in and delete the data."
    mala "Darius has already done it, and knows how it works. We just want you to get accustomed to the schema you'll be writing the script for before next sprint."
    player "Got it! So I just need to go into the demo database and delete old data?"
    mala "Exactly! Any data older than two weeks should do it. Anything before that, and the data isn't really useful to the sales team anymore."
    player "Cool! That sounds easy enough. What kind of database is it?"
    mala "We set up a Postgres database. If you check out the onboarding document we sent you when you got here, you'll find the command you need to access it."
    mala "You just need to MAKE SURE that you play with the data in staging first before you start deleting anything."
    player "I've been meaning to ask that for a while now - what is Staging? "
    mala "So we have a few different databases and development environments we set up for our clients:"
    mala "First is your Local database, which is just a version of the database that exists on your computer. "
    mala "When you modify it or any of the data inside of it, those changes are only happening on YOUR machine - that is to say, locally."
    mala "Next, there's your Prod environment; Prod is short for “Production”."
    mala "This is the data that actually gets accessed by our apps and websites when they're live and displayed publicly."
    mala "Finally, we have Staging: Staging is “live” in the sense that it isn't only on your computer, but it isn't possible to be viewed by people outside of the company."
    mala "It basically allows us to play around with data and features and see how they'd actually look in production. So it's kind of an in-between."
    mala "All of these databases usually have different seeds. Staging usually has WAY more data than Production."
    mala "Whenever we need to make changes to a Prod database -"
    mala "- which the Sales Demo database is - "
    mala "we typically make it to the Staging database first."
    mala "This is because we set our Staging database up so that it refreshes all of the seeds once a week automatically, or with a simple command if we mess something up."
    mala "So you can make as many mistakes as you like while you get the hang of things. (HAPPY)"
    player "Okay - that was a lot of information, but I think I got all of that!"
    player "I guess now that's left to do is start!"
    mala @ smile "That's what I love about you fishie - you've got so much energy!"
    mala "Just remember -"
    mala " - and I CANNOT stress this enough - "
    mala "experiment with your queries and delete commands in Staging BEFORE trying them out in our Production environment, okay?"
    mala "And don't forget that you can always ping me if you need any help!"
    player "Gotcha!"

    player "This isn't so bad!"
    player "I haven't written SQL in some time - I forgot how fun it was. (HAPPY)"

        "...have as many features and technologies as possible":
            player "... because if you know lots of technologies, the chance of you getting a job is much higher!"
            player "Plus, having a ton of features will really show off your versatility."
            teen "Wow, really?"
            teen "I had no clue!"
            player "Yep! So make sure you really get to studying so you can be a jack of all trades!"
            teen "Got it! I'm going to grab some coffee, find a comfortable spot, and get started on my portfolio!"
            "Annika and Layla share a look. They both look concerned."
            "Layla quickly whispers something to Annika, and they both nod."
            layla "... hey, you said you're going to grab some coffee?"
            layla "I could use a cup too. Why don't I come with you?"
            teen "Sure!"
            "The two of them walk off, the budding developer excitedly talking about his latest project."
            annika "Hey [player_name], did you really mean what you said a few minutes ago?"
            player "Sure! I mean, I feel like I got really lucky landing this job, since I only know about 4 or 5 technologies."
            player "I bet I could have gotten even more interviews if I knew 9 or 10!"
            annika "I see..."
            annika "I just ask, because I definitely wouldn't say that that was the most important thing that he should have been focusing on."
            player "Oh no! What should I have said instead?"
            annika "I mean, think about it:"
            annika "The point of having a portfolio as a developer with no experience is to show a potential employer that you know how to do what they need you to do on the job."
            annika "So a project in a portfolio should show off all of the basic skills of a junior developer."
            player "What do you have in mind?"
            annika "Well, during my interview process, I was asked to describe MVC, and how it worked."
            annika "I was also asked to explain how HTTP requests work."
            annika "So, I would use projects that have a good frontend and a backend that either I made, or an API that I've called."
            annika "That way, they'd know that I know how to make HTTP requests or API's."
            annika "Knowing how to use a dozen technologies doesn't mean that you're going to be a good developer."
            annika "I got hired for this position, and I didn't even know most of the technologies that they asked for."
            annika "Once you know one programming language, you can kind of pick up any of them more easily."
            annika "As far as adding a million features,"
            annika "I wanted to do the same thing while I was building my portfolio."
            annika "But one of my mentors said that 4 or 5 good features per project would be more than enough."
            annika "He actually told me that I should just focus on making TWO good projects."
            annika "It was kind of funny, but he said that it's rare for juniors to even FINISH projects."
            annika "He told me that even having two polished, finished projects would impress a panel of interviewers."
            annika "Otherwise, how are you going to PROVE you know the many technologies you say that you do?"
            player "Sheesh! That's so embarrassing!"
            annika "It's okay! We're only juniors. "
            annika "It's just best for new devs to focus on showing off their skills and the functionality of their app rather than how they look,"
            annika "or using a million technologies, or things like that."
            player "So I just told that guy something wrong... What if he follows my advice?"
            annika "Don't worry - Layla's having a chat with him to set him straight. "
            annika "So it's okay!"
            "You lose 10 Energy out of embarrassment."
