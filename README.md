#### How to help with translation

The Crowdin (our localization platform) link will be posted here shortly.

##### Instructions
- The sentences to be translated are always between `""`. These are dialogues or UI strings.
- In case of `new "..."` Do not translate `new`. 
- Prefixes like `player`, `annika`, `layla`, `marco` (or variants like `player @ happy`) should not be translated.
- Do not translate things between `[]` and `{}`. These are variable interpolations and text tags.

##### Examples

###### Before translation

```renpy
# "[player_name]? What a coincidence! Our VIP team member {a=[vip_profile_url]}[player_name]{/a} will be honored to hear that."
"[player_name]? What a coincidence! Our VIP team member {a=[vip_profile_url]}[player_name]{/a} will be honored to hear that."  <--- this is the line that needs to be translated. see translation below
```

###### After translation

```renpy
# "[player_name]? What a coincidence! Our VIP team member {a=[vip_profile_url]}[player_name]{/a} will be honored to hear that."
"[player_name]ÔºüÂ•ΩÂ∑ßÔºåÊàë‰ª¨ÁöÑVIPÈòüÂèã{a=[vip_profile_url]}[player_name]{/a}‰ºöÂæàÈ´òÂÖ¥ÁöÑ„ÄÇ"
```

Note: The `[]` and `{}` tags should be left intact.

###### Before translation

```renpy
old "{icon=icon-fast-forward} Skip"
new "{icon=icon-fast-forward} Skip" <-- translate this line, see below
```

###### After translation

```renpy
old "{icon=icon-fast-forward} Skip"
new "{icon=icon-fast-forward} Ë∑≥Ëøá"
```

Note: Again, the `new` prefix and the `{icon=icon-fast-forward}` tag should be left intact.

###### Before translation

```renpy
# layla @ neutral "Hehe, [player_name], you are a fun one. I'm sure you will enjoy your work as a developer."
layla @ neutral "Hehe, [player_name], you are a fun one. I'm sure you will enjoy your work as a developer."
```

###### After translation

```renpy
# layla @ neutral "Hehe, [player_name], you are a fun one. I'm sure you will enjoy your work as a developer."
layla @ neutral "ÂìàÂìàÔºå[player_name]Ôºå‰Ω†ÁúüÊúâË∂£„ÄÇÊàëÁõ∏‰ø°‰Ω†‰∏ÄÂÆö‰ºöÂñúÊ¨¢‰Ω†ÁöÑÂºÄÂèëËÄÖÂ∑•‰ΩúÁöÑ„ÄÇ"
```

Note: `layla @ neutral` and `[player_name]` are left unchanged.
